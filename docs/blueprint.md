## Core Features:

- Room Browsing and Filtering: Browse and filter available rooms based on location, price, availability, and other criteria, pulling the details from https://tripath.colivingsoft.site/api/version/2.0/default/rooms/feed. Display rooms in a grid or map view, similar to Spotahome or Airbnb.
- Room Detail Page: View detailed room information, including photos, descriptions, pricing, and availability. Include a 'Reserve now' CTA with a sticky sidebar showing a reservation summary and final price. Embed videos (YouTube) and floorplan previews (PDF).
- Reservation Wizard: Guide users through a multi-step reservation process, where they select dates, enter personal information, upload identification, and view the generated rental contract, but stop short of requiring payment.
